        android:text="We are a group of students who had an interest in building a mobile application. We tried to come up with an idea for its purpose and realized something. These days, students struggle with their classes and have trouble finding people to study with. The goal of StuDying+ is to solve this problem and effectively match you up with other people who are also in need of studying for the same subject and material as you. Users will be able to create an account and update information about themselves on their user profile much like a social hub. The groups are created for the students by the students. We hope groups will be able to operate on their own with help from their group leader. A worrying trend with groups is that typically one student does most of the work. To circumvent the issue, a rating system was implemented. Ratings will only be issued to someone by other members in the groups they have been in. We hope this system will alleviate the worries of users. Our team is focused on providing a user-friendly environment so that it will help in your studies."
